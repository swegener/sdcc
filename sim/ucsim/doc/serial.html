    <h1>Using serial interfaces</h1>
    <h3>Connecting a terminal</h3>
    You can easily connect a terminal to the serial interface of the simulated
    microcontroller. This terminal is just a file so it can be anything which is
    represented as a file. It even can be a real serial line of the computer:
    <pre><font color="blue">$</font> ucsim_51 -s/dev/ttyS1
</pre>
    <p><img src="serial_comport.svg"></p>
    <p>Of course you must use the actual device name of your operating system.
      Device name <tt>ttyS1</tt> above is used in Linux systems. Your system
      can use other names. </p>
    <p>You can use a terminal of your system. It can be a virtual console if
      your system provides such as Linux does for example. On X Windows you can
      use <b>xterm</b> windows as terminals, one for running the simulator and
      one as a terminal on CPU's serial line. Here is a sample how to do this: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the terminal window which will be connected to the serial
        line:
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Check the device name which represents the terminal:
            <pre><font color="blue">$</font> tty
<font color="green">/dev/ttyp1</font>
</pre> </li>
          <li>Disconnect the shell from the terminal. Usually I use the <b>tail</b>
            command and any existing text file:
            <pre><font color="blue">$</font> tail -f $HOME/.profile
</pre> </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Run the simulator in the other window:
        <pre><font color="blue">$</font> ucsim_51 -s/dev/ttyp1 program.hex
</pre> Use the output of the <b>tty</b> command above as the parameter of the <tt>-s</tt>
        option. </li>
    </ol>
    <p> Every character sent out by the simulated program appears in the
      "terminal" window and every character you type in there will be received
      by the simulated controller's serial line.</p>
    <p><b><i>Notes</i></b></p>
    <p>-s option is deprecated, it is recommended to use -S instead. Option -S
      provides more features and flexibility but it requires to use different
      syntax:</p>
    <p>-S subopt1,subopt2,...</p>
    <p>Known suboptions are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>uart=nr<br>
        This option specifies ID of the uart that following options will be
        attached to. Default is 0.</li>
      <li>in=filename<br>
        Specified file will be used as input for the uart. When simulated uart
        is able to receive, it will get content of this file.</li>
      <li>out=filename<br>
        Specified file will be used as output for the uart. When simulated uart
        sends a byte, it will be written into this file.</li>
      <li>port=nr<br>
        Specified port number will be listened for incoming connections (TCP
        server) and if connected, the socket will be used as both input and
        output for the uart.</li>
      <li>iport=nr<br>
        Specified port number will be listened for incoming connections (TCP
        server) and if connected, the socket will be used as input of the uart.</li>
      <li>oport=nr<br>
        Specified port number will be listened for incoming connections (TCP
        server) and if connected, the socket will be used as output of the uart.</li>
      <li>raw<br>
        Raw, non-interactive communication will be performed on both input and
        output files. Default is interactive (non-raw) mode.</li>
    </ul>
    Input and output file can be a regular file or a special one, for example
    pipe (fifo) or a TCP socket. If a file is a tty, the simulator will assume
    that a terminal is connected and will start an interactive session. TCP
    socket is treated as a tty, and telnet protocol is used to control the
    terminal settings. This can be turned off by <b>raw</b> suboption. If <b>raw</b>
    is used, simulator will not perform any terminal control and will not
    use/interpret telnet protocol commands.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Connecting two instances of simulator</h3>
    Executing two instances of the simulator, serial lines of two simulators
    (micros) can be connected together so they can talk to each other over their
    serial interface. It is because you can specify separate files for serial
    input and output. For example, you run two simulators "1" and "2", here is
    the sample how to connect them:
    <p><img src="serial1.svg"> </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Make two FIFOs to represent physical wires in serial cable connecting
        two micros:
        <pre><font color="blue">$</font> mkfifo 1-2 2-1 <font color="magenta"># 1-2: 1-&gt;2  and 2-1: 2-&gt;1</font>
</pre> </li>
      <li>Start two simulators and specify the FIFOs as input and output of
        serial interface:
        <pre><font color="blue">term1 $</font> <font color="magenta"># start sim "1"</font>
<font color="blue">term1 $</font> ucsim_51 -Sin=2-1,out=1-2,raw program_1_.hex
<font color="blue">term2 $</font> <font color="magenta"># start sim "2"</font>
<font color="blue">term2 $</font> ucsim_51 -Sout=2-1,in=1-2,raw program_2_.hex
</pre> Because opening a pipe blocks the program until other direction is
        opened, the order of arguments above is <b>important</b>!
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>Debug programs as usual. </li>
    </ol>
    Using the most useful unix commands <b>cat</b> and <b>tee</b> and just
    some more FIFOs you can monitor serial communication, here is a sample:
    <p><img src="serial2.svg"> </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Make some FIFOs to use between simulators and tee "monitors":
        <pre><font color="blue">$</font> mkfifo 1_tee tee_2 2_tee tee_2
</pre> </li>
      <li>Run monitoring programs (in two xterms for example):
        <pre><font color="blue">xterm1 $</font> cat 1_tee|tee /dev/tty &gt;tee_2 # monitor 1-&gt;2
<font color="blue">xterm2 $</font> cat 2_tee|tee /dev/tty &gt;tee_1 # monitor 2-&gt;1
</pre> </li>
      <li>Now you can start simulators (on two other terminals:)
        <pre><font color="blue">xterm3 $</font> ucsim_51 -Sin=tee_1,out=1_tee,raw program_1_.hex
<font color="blue">xterm4 $</font> ucsim_51 -Sin=tee_2,out=2_tee,raw program_2_.hex
</pre> </li>
      <li>Start your apps and listen what they are talking about. </li>
    </ol>
