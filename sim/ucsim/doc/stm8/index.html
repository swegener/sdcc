  <h1>Features of the STM8 Simulator</h1>


  <h2>Cycle Counts</h2>

  Instruction timings are correct and take into account pipeline overlaps
  and stall cycles. The only known exceptions are HALT, WFI and WFE which
  are either not yet implemented or, in the case of HALT, only partially
  and minimally implemented.

  <h3>Notes on Documention</h3>

  <h4>PM0044 Section 5.3 Pipelined execution examples</h4>
      <p>There are some errors in these tables. See the trace outputs in the
      <a href="#exanal">Example Analyses</a> section below for details.</p>

  <h4>PM0044 Section 7.4 Instruction Set</h4>
      <p>The cycle counts shown for instructions in PM0044 section 7 are one less
          than the actual counts because the first decode cycle of an instruction
          normally overlaps with the last execution cycle of the preceeding
          instruction.</p>


  <h3>Stall Cycle Detection</h3>

  <p>Error/warning event reporting of stall cycles is available should timings
  be important in your application.
      <pre>0&gt; <font color="#118811">show error</font>
  Error: non-classified [on/ON]
    [...]
    Error: stm8 [off/OFF]
      Warning: pipeline [unset/OFF]
        Warning: decode_stall [unset/OFF]
        Warning: fetch_stall [unset/OFF]
    [...]</pre>

  <p>These are off by default but may be enabled as required either as a group:
      <pre>0&gt; <font color="#118811">set error pipeline</font></pre>
  or individually:
      <pre>0&gt; <font color="#118811">set error decode_stall on</font>
0&gt; <font color="#118811">set error fetch_stall on</font></pre>
  </p>


  <h3>Cycle and Pipeline Analysis</h3>

  <p>The simulator is able to generate detailed analyses of execution showing timings
  for each instruction executed including pipeline overlaps and stalls. This is controlled
  via the <em>pipetrace</em> feature of the STM8 CPU module. The output is in the form
  of a self-contained HTML document that can be opened with a browser or imported into
  other application documentation.</p>

  <p>To generate a pipeline analysis:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>Set the title for the next pipetrace to be opened.
          <pre>0&gt; <font color="#118811">set hw cpu pipetrace title "..."</font></pre>
      </li>

      <li>Replace the embedded default styling with a stylesheet link to the given URL.
          <pre>0&gt; <font color="#118811">set hw cpu pipetrace style "<i>url</i>"</font></pre>
      </li>

      <li>Open the given file, write the header (including title and stylesheet) and
          continue writing the pipeline analysis as instructions are executed.
          <pre>0&gt; <font color="#118811">set hw cpu pipetrace start "<i>path</i>"</font></pre>
      </li>

      <li>Set folding of the analysis on (the default) or off. Folding causes the cycle
          count to be reset to zero (moving the output back to the left) after every
          pipeline flush (i.e. after every branch, jump or call). It is recommended you
          leave this on unless you have <em>very</em> wide paper or are single stepping
          and annotating the analysis between steps.
          <pre>0&gt; <font color="#118811">set hw cpu pipetrace fold [on|off]</font></pre>
      </li>

      <li>Pause writing the pipeline analysis. The output file remains open but nothing
          will be written to as instructions are executed.
          <pre>0&gt; <font color="#118811">set hw cpu pipetrace pause</font></pre>
      </li>

      <li>Insert the given text into the current pipeline analysis. The text is
          inserted verbatim and may contain HTML markup. If the output is not
          paused the cycle count for the analysis is set back to zero so that the
          next instruction output will be moved back to the left (the first cycle
          after the inserted text does however overlap the last cycle before the
          inserted text as normal).
          <pre>0&gt; <font color="#118811">set hw cpu pipetrace data "<i>text</i>"</font></pre>
      </li>

      <li>Resume a paused pipeline analysis. Instruction execution will update the
          analysis output again. Resuming a paused analysis resets the cycle count
          to zero so that the next instruction output is moved back to the left.
          (The next cycle may or may not overlap the last cycle before the pause
          depending on whether or not any instructions were executed while the
          output was paused.)
          <pre>0&gt; <font color="#118811">set hw cpu pipetrace resume</font></pre>
      </li>

      <li>Stop the pipeline analysis and close the output file. No further analysis will
          occur until a new analysis file is started.
          <pre>0&gt; <font color="#118811">set hw cpu pipetrace stop</font></pre>
      </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Example Analyses</h3>

  <h4>Documented Examples</h4>

  <p>These are taken from the examples in ST's &ldquo;PM0044 Programming Manual&rdquo;
  section &ldquo;5.3 Pipelined execution examples&rdquo; and are generated by
  the test <a href="../../stm8.src/test/stm8-cycles">ucsim/stm8.src/test/stm8-cycles</a>
  using the &ldquo;pipetrace&rdquo;functionality described above.</p>

  <p>Note that there are some errors in the examples in section 5.3. These are noted in
  the output below and the differences confirmed on HW.</p>

  <h3>Hardware Cycle Counting</h3>

  <p>Actual cycle counts may be obtained from hardware for comparison using a combination
  of <a href="https://stm8-binutils-gdb.sourceforge.io">stm8-gdb</a>, openocd and an STLink
  or other openocd/SWIM compatible debugger. Set the master and CPU clocks to be equivalent
  and use one of the target's timers to count cycles.</p>
  <p>For instance:</p>
  <blockquote><pre>
$ openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm8s003.cfg &amp;
$ stm8-gdb
[...]
(gdb) target extended-remote :3333


(gdb) set $DM_CSR2 = 0x7f99
(gdb) set $DM_ENFCTR = 0x7f9a

(gdb) set $CLK_CKDIVR  = 0x50c6
(gdb) set $CLK_PCKENR1 = 0x50c7

(gdb) set $TIM2_CR1  = 0x5300
(gdb) set $TIM2_EGR  = 0x5306
(gdb) set $TIM2_CNTRH = 0x530c
(gdb) set $TIM2_CNTRL = 0x530d
(gdb) set $TIM2_PSCR = 0x530e


(gdb) define cycles
    dont-repeat

    # Freeze TIM2 when CPU is stalled by DM
    set {unsigned char}$DM_ENFCTR = 0xfd

    # Set HSIDIV = 0, CPUDIV = 0
    set {unsigned char}$CLK_CKDIVR = 0x00
    # Set TIM2 prescalar to 0 so f_CK_CNT matches f_MASTER (and hence f_CPU)
    set {unsigned char}$TIM2_PSCR = 0x00

    # Clear count and update config
    set {unsigned char}$TIM2_EGR = 1
    set {unsigned char}$TIM2_CNTRH = 0xff
    set {unsigned char}$TIM2_CNTRL = 0xff

    # Enable counter
    set {unsigned char}$TIM2_CR1  = 0x01
    # Enable clock gate
    set {unsigned char}$CLK_PCKENR1 = 0x20

    # Set PC
    # N.B. Do not attempt to flush the decoder by writing to DM_CSR2. It upsets
    # openocd which is then unable to set breakpoints.
    set $pc = $arg0
    #set {unsigned char}$DM_CSR2 = 0x81

    # Set a HW breakpoint, run, then clear
    monitor bp $arg1 1 hw
    cont
    monitor rbp $arg1

    set $_tmp = {unsigned short}$TIM2_CNTR
    disass/r $arg0,$arg1
    printf "%u cycles\n", $_tmp
end

(gdb) document cycles
Set PC to the first address, set a HW break at the second address,
run and report how many cycles (as reported by $TIM2_CNTR) it took.
The target is assumed to be halted initially.
end

(gdb) monitor reset halt

(gdb) cycles 0x811c 0x8122

14 cycles
  </pre></blockquote>

  <p>Don't forget that there will be an initial pipeline fetch cycle
  before the first instruction can be decoded, there may be stall
  cycles, multiple instructions (mostly) overlap by one cycle (which is
  assumed in the timings given by PM0044), and you may have interrupts
  that should be disabled.</p>
