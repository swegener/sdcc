    <h1>Peripheral displays</h1>

    <p>There are text based, interactive user intarfaces for simulated
      peripherals, which are called <b>peripheral displays</b>. They
      can be usefull for peripherals which can generate input data for
      the microcontroller, such as ports (GPIO), uarts. Some displays
      are used to show information in non-interactive way, for example <a href="#register_display">dreg</a> register display.</p>

    <p>Peripheral display can be turned on using <a href="cmd_general.html#set_console_hw">set console hw</a> command where <i>hw</i> is the name of the peripheral.</p>

    <h2>Control simulator with peripheral display</h2>

    <p>Each peripheral display interpret some control keys (a key
      pressed while CTRL is hold). They can be used to control the
      simulator, or the display itself.</p>

    <dl>
      
      <dt><b>CTRL-s</b>, <b>CTRL-r</b>, <b>CTRL-g</b></dt>
      <dd>Change run state of the simulator: start/stop
      simulation. Actual state is displayed at the right side of the
	first line.</dd>
      
      <dt><b>CTRL-t</b></dt>
      <dd>Reset CPU.</dd>
      
      <dt><b>CTRL-q</b></dt>
      <dd>Quit simulator, it is the same as the <a href="cmd_general.html#kill">kill</a> command.</dd>

      <dt><b>CTRL-o</b></dt>
      <dd>Close the display and return to the command console.</dd>

      <dt><b>CTRL-l</b></dt>
      <dd>Redraw the content of the display.</dd>

      <dt><b>CTRL-n</b></dt>
      <dd>Switch display to the next hardware element (peripheral) of
	the microcontroller which has display feature implemented.</dd>
      
    </dl>

    <p>Please note, that uart peripheral use a different display (<a href="#uart_display">see
      below</a>) where control keys are not available by default, you
    have to press a hot-key first to display the simulator control
    menu.</p>

    <p>Some peripherals can not be used to input external data into
      the system and do not have special display implemented. When you
      open display of them you will see the same information what you
      can check using <a href="">info hw</a> command.</p>

    <a name="uart_display"><h2>Uart display</h2></a>

    <p>Display of any uart peripheral is spcial because it acts like a
      terminal emulator, connected to simulated uart. It doesn't have
      control menu like other displays, but you can show it by
      pressing a special <i>escape</i> key. This
      escape key is CTRL-x by default, but you can configure it. </p>

    <p>If the simulated uart sends a character (byte), it will be
    printed on the screen, so that how non-ascii charaters are shown
    is up to your terminal where the program was started.</p>

    <p>Local echo is off, which means that key presses are not
      printed, they will be received by the simulated uart.</p>

    <p>If you press the escape key, you will see the control menu, as
    shown on the above screenshot. Keys of the menu can be pressed
    alone or by holding CTRL down.</p>

    
    <h3>Configure uart display escape charater</h3>

    <p>There is a variable which holds ascii code of the escape
      charater, to configure it you can set the appropriate variable. The variable is called</p>

    <p><tt>uartX_esc_char</tt></p>

    <p>where X is id number of the uart (there can be more than one
      uarts in the controller, distinguised by their id numbers).</p>

    <p>CTRL ascii codes are between 0 and 31, so for example, if you
      are going to use CTRL-u, the easiest way to set it is:</p>

    <pre>
0&gt; <font color="#118811">expr uart0_esc_char='U'-'A'+1</font>

    </pre>

    <p>Some CTRL combinations can be recognized by the operating
    system's terminal driver (for example ^z and ^c on linux), these
      conbinations are not recommended to use.</p>

    <p>It is also not recommended to use characters (either alone or
      with CTRL) used on control menu, such as <b>s</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>g</b>, <b>p</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>q</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>e</b>,
      <b>n</b>.</p>

    
    <a name="register_display"><h2>Register display</h2></a>

    <p>Register set of the CPU is not a peripheral but could be
      usefull to show that as a display. To accomplish this, all
      simulators include a special "virtual" peripheral, called <b>dreg</b>, which, when displayed, shows the registers, the same way as the <a href="cmd_general.html#info_registers">info registers</a>
      command.</p>
